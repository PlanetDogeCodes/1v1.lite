# 1v1.lite
1v1.lite is a packaged and optimized version of 1v1.lol that runs exceptionally well on low end devices, such as chromebooks. This repository contains the latest stable version of 1v1.lite along with the source (xml, js, and json) files.

HOW IT WORKS: Just like eagletcraft, 1v1.lite was made by distibuting the core code of 1v1.lol into many seperate hosted files. The files then all communicate via one html page/iframe where the game is outputted using a custom WebGL engine. This leads to the offloading of static files (files that aren't currently being accessed) to your computer's flash memory, leading to a smooth, resource-minimal experience at the cost of in-game loading times.

WHY IT WORKS: The reason 1v1.lite runs so well with low ram usage is because none of your computer's RAM is being wasted trying to update static files every milisecond.

NOTICE: Unless you are in a situation where you cannot access the link, we recommend you play our constantly updating, cloud-connected OneCompiler edition of 1v1.lite instead of downloading the latest patch edition. [https://onecompiler.com/html/43rjjm8te](https://onecompiler.com/html/44dhca6z5)
